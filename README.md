  * The Art of turning an entrepreneurial venture into a success.The Science of practice as the heart of starting and running a successful entrepreneurial venture.The Process that tie these two areas together into a coherent and organized business.
  * With its adaptive learning tools, students learn the art, science, and process of designing, starting, and managing a small business. Through its real-world approach, students are placed in the roles of a financial analyst, marketer, and business owners, and think critically to develop their plan to survive in the ever-changing business world.
